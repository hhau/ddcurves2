ddcurves2: depth density curve models in stan
================
Andrew Manderson

`ddcurves2`
===========

This is a private R package to enable the faster iteration of Stan models and outputs. Limited current functionality.

Installation notes
==================

This package is an absolute pain to build, it is finicky and brittle.

Install via `devtools::install_github("hhau/ddcurves2", local=FALSE)`

If you don't install / build with `local = FALSE`, the compiler gets al-mightily confused upon reinstall
